# CodeQL Advanced: Self-Healing, Autonomous, Non-Interfering Agent
#
# - Agentic: Diagnoses and attempts to resolve its own failures (e.g., permissions, missing build)
# - Non-intrusive: Restricts scope to only its own job, never modifies or blocks other workflows
# - Collaborates with Copilot (or other agents) by raising issues with actionable context on persistent failures
# - Layered error handling: Self-repairs simple config issues, escalates only when agentic repair fails
# - Production-grade: Minimal redundancy, audit trail, clear rationale
#
# See References at EOF for standards and foundational links.
