## Branch Cleanup Recommendations

The following feature branches can be safely deleted as their work has been merged:

- `copilot/fix-2` (PR #3 - work consolidated in main)
- `copilot/fix-7` (PR #8 - conflicts resolved)
- `copilot/fix-12` (PR #13 - work consolidated)  
- `copilot/fix-14` (PR #15 - work consolidated)

## Prevention Guidelines

### For Contributors

1. **Always search before creating issues:**
   - Use GitHub's search to check both open and closed issues
   - Check if the work might already be in progress in a PR
   
2. **Use appropriate labels:**
   - bug, enhancement, documentation, help wanted, etc.
   
3. **Follow naming conventions:**
   - Use descriptive, unique titles
   - Avoid generic titles like "Set up X" without context

### For Maintainers

1. **Regular deduplication reviews:**
   - Monthly check for similar issues
   - Proactive closing of obvious duplicates
   - Cross-reference with PR activity

2. **Branch hygiene:**
   - Delete feature branches after merge
   - Close stale PRs that duplicate merged work

## Summary

‚úÖ **All duplicate issues successfully identified and were already resolved**
‚úÖ **Repository contains fully consolidated work in main branch**  
‚úÖ **Preventive measures implemented to stop future duplicates**
‚úÖ **Clear documentation and processes established**
‚úÖ **Ready for ongoing maintenance with new guidelines**

The deduplication process revealed that the repository's existing merge process had already successfully consolidated all duplicate work. The main preventive measures were the missing issue templates and branch cleanup procedures, which have now been implemented.
